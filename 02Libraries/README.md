In order to do useful stuff, we often need to give ourselves special powers of awesome open-source projects.

In this example we'll be using OpenCV to do image analysis -- the same used for modern Robots :cool:

Give your program more superpowers, and let's load some libraries!


## Command Line Library


## IDE Library


//TODO grab java opencv library

Copy-Pasta to the libraries folder, and then click `add to build path` that was easy...

now to use it in your code do the following

//TODO add opencv stuff here later


## Android Library

<!-- android library will be the same in this system -->
<!-- also show how to display the processed file -->
