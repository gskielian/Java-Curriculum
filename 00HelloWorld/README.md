## Command Line Building


* You must:
  * name your class the same as the filename (so HelloWorld.java must have the `public class HelloWorld {` etc.)
  * name an `main class`
    * you must include this somewhere


* Conventions:
  * Use UpperCamelCase for class names
  * Use lowerCamelCase for members of the class (like the listed methods, and characteristics or fields) 


```java 
public class HelloWorld {
  
  public static void main (String args[]) {

    System.out.println("Hello World!");
  
  }
  
}
```

#### To create and run your java file:


**compile**
```sh
javac HelloWorld.java
```

**run**

```sh
java HelloWorld
```
