algorithms are not dry when they are useful.


we'll have Big data applications (sorting is really important).

* Sports -- recruiting and stats sifting -- moneyball
* Medicine -- analyzing samples from an outbreak
* Robots -- determining the best path from A to B using different algorithms.
* Machine Learning -- automatically adjust your `nest` temperature

## Zombie-Outbreak Epicenter

You have 3 units and you want to get to the epicenter in order to address the source.


Cities will give a number of reported zombie infections.
They are handling it right now, but we need to find the epicenter in order.

Assume the zombie outbreak begins in a city.

With limited forces you are asked to direct your units to quarantine certain cities.


First find geometric epicenter,
then find cities nearest to that epicenter (algorithm()
